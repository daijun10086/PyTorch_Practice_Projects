# PyTorch_Practice_Projects

This repository contains projects that I have developed to practice using PyTorch, a widely-used framework for building AI models. PyTorch allows for the quick and effective creation of AI models from scratch, regardless of whether they are used for computer vision or natural language processing tasks. It is important to become familiar with this framework, and to that end, I have decided to complete several classical projects, such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. This repository might includes references to other GitHub repositories and [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).
